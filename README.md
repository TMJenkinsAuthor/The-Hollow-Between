# The Hollow Between

**A moody personal author site** for showcasing dark fiction, poetic thrillers, and the weight of what goes unsaid.

This site is designed with a minimalist HTML/CSS structure, optimized for a cinematic, gothic aesthetic — shadows, velvet tones, and whispered truths.

- 🖼️ **Gallery** — Visual storytelling through images and aesthetics
- 📝 **Blog** — A space for microfiction, musings, and literary whispers
- 📬 **Contact** — Simple form for direct outreach

## 🕯️ Aesthetic Inspiration
